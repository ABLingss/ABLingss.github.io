        <title>Three Go Games of Life</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to introduce myself through the ancient game of Go. Just as a Go board has 361 possibilities, my life has been shaped by calculated moves, unexpected setbacks, and unbrokenable friendlyship—even when the game doesn’t go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening phase of Go is all about balancing ambition and caution, however, I learned this the hard way. At 12, I lost my first official Go match because of reckless opening moves. That time my mentor said I was building castles on the sand,asking me to focus on fundamentals and stability. So I started studying classic strategies, practicing daily, and avoiding shortcuts. One year later, I finally achieved second dan. Go taught me that a strong foundation matters more than early victories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle game is all about adaptability. Once, I faced a seasoned player who trapped me. Panicking, I made impulsive moves and lost. That time I froze under pressure and misread the strategies. But then I reviewed every mistake, journaled my errors, trained with stronger opponents, and eventually overcame my fear of failure. Go’s middle game taught me that defeat isn’t failure unless you stop learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go’s endgame taught me that even solo games need connection. When I was trailing by 3 points, my hands trembling, my childhood friend, who had trained with me for years, whispered, “Breathe. You’ve faced harder fights.” Her calmness calm me down. Inspired, I won by half a point. Later, when she struggled with depression, I returned the support, reminding her of our Go mantra: “Stones may fall, but the board remains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life of me, like Go, isn’t about winning every match. My three battles taught me to value growth over titles. Today, I’m still a Go amateur—but every game deepens my respect for strategy, adaptability, and friendlyship. The board remains my teacher, reminding me: “&lt;strong&gt;A lost game still holds winning lessons.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
